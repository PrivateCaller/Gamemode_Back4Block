# Gamemode_Left4Block

This is a gamemode for Blockland, its purpose is to recreate the experience of the hit zombie game 'Left 4 Dead' in the Blockland experience. This pack features
weapons, grenades, the zombie bots, a director, and multiple features. It is quite an expanded list, I will eventually update this readme to include more important information
about the gamemode.
